<p>
        OK, so you have finally decided to write your own Check.  Welcome
        aboard, this is really a fun thing to do.  There are actually two
        kinds of Checks, so before you can start, you have to find out
        which kind of Check you want to implement.
      </p>
<p>
        The functionality of Checkstyle is implemented in modules that can
        be plugged into Checkstyle. Modules can be containers for other
        modules, i.e. they form a tree structure. The toplevel modules
        that are known directly to the Checkstyle kernel (which is also a
        module and forms the root of the tree) implement the <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/FileSetCheck.html">FileSetCheck</a>
        interface. These are pretty simple to grasp: they take a set of
        input files and fire error messages.
      </p>
<p>
        Checkstyle provides a few FileSetCheck implementations by default
        and one of them happens to be the <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/TreeWalker.html">TreeWalker</a>. A
        TreeWalker supports submodules that are derived from the <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/Check.html">Check</a>
        class. The TreeWalker operates by separately transforming each of
        the Java input files into an abstract syntax tree and then handing
        the result over to each of the Check submodules which in turn have
        a look at a certain aspect of the tree.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="Writing_Checks"></a>Writing Checks</h2>
<p>
        Most of the functionality of Checkstyle is implemented as
        Checks. If you know how to write your own Checks, you can extend
        Checkstyle according to your needs without having to wait for the
        Checkstyle development team. You are about to become a Checkstyle
        Expert.
      </p>
<p>
        Suppose you have a convention that the number of methods in a
        class should not exceed a certain limit, say 30. This rule makes
        sense, a class should only do one thing and do it well. With a
        zillion methods chances are that the class does more than one
        thing. The only problem you have is that your convention is not
        checked by Checkstyle, so you'll have to write your own Check
        and plug it into the Checkstyle framework.
      </p>
<p> This chapter is organized as a tour that takes you
      through the process step by step and explains both the theoretical
      foundations and the <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/package-summary.html">Checkstyle
      API</a> along the way.  </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="Java_Grammar"></a>Java Grammar</h2>
<p>
        Every Java Program is structured into files, and each of these
        files has a certain structure. For example, if there is a
        package statement then it is the first line of the file that is
        not comment or whitespace. After the package statement comes a
        list of import statements, which is followed by a class or
        interface definition, and so on.
      </p>
<p>
        If you have ever read an introductory level Java book you probably
        knew all of the above. And if you have studied computer science,
        you probably also know that the rules that specify the Java language
        can be formally specified using a grammar (statement is simplified
        for didactic purposes).
      </p>
<p>
        Tools exist which read a grammar definition and produce a parser
        for the language that is specified in the grammar. In other
        words, the output of the tool is a program that can transform a
        stream of characters (a Java file) into a tree representation
        that reflects the structure of the file. Checkstyle uses the
        parser generator <a href="http://www.antlr.org" class="externalLink">ANTLR</a> but
        that is an implementation detail you do not need to worry about
        when writing Checks. Several other parser generators exist and
        they all work well.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="The_Checkstyle_SDK_Gui"></a>The Checkstyle SDK Gui</h2>
<p>
        Still with us? Great, you have mastered the basic theory so here
        is your reward - a GUI that displays the structure of a Java
        source file. To run it type
      </p>
<div class="source"><pre>
java -classpath checkstyle-5.3-all.jar \
     com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.gui.Main
      </pre>
</div>
<p>
        on the command line. Click the button at the bottom of the frame
        and select a syntactically correct Java source file. The frame
        will be populated with a tree that corresponds to the structure
        of the Java source code.
      </p>
<p><img src="images/gui_screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>
<p> In the leftmost column you can open and close branches
      of the tree, the remaining columns display information about each node
      in the tree.  The second column displays a token type for each node. As
      you navigate from the root of the tree to one of the leafs, you'll
      notice that the token type denotes smaller and smaller units of your
      source file, i.e. close to the root you might see the token type <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/TokenTypes.html#CLASS_DEF">CLASS_DEF</a>
      (a node that represents a class definition) while you will see token
      types like IDENT (an identifier) near the leaves of the tree.  </p>
<p>
        We'll get back to the details in the other columns later, they
        are important for implementing Checks but not for understanding
        the basic concepts. For now it is sufficient to know that the
        gui is a tool that lets you look at the structure of a Java
        file, i.e. you can see the Java grammar 'in action'.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="Understanding_the_visitor_pattern"></a>Understanding the visitor pattern</h2>
<p>
        Ready for a bit more theory? The last bit
        that is missing before you can start writing Checks is understanding
        the Visitor pattern.
      </p>
<p>
        When working with ASTs, a simple approach to define check operations
        on them would be to add a <code>check()</code> method to the Class that defines
        the AST nodes. For example, our AST type could have a method
        <code>checkNumberOfMethods()</code>. Such an approach would suffer from a few
        serious drawbacks. Most importantly, it does not provide an extensible
        design, i.e. the Checks have to be known at compile time; there is no
        way to write plugins.
      </p>
<p> Hence Checkstyle's AST classes do not have any
      methods that implement checking functionality. Instead,
      Checkstyle's <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/TreeWalker.html">TreeWalker</a>
      takes a set of objects that conform to a <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/Check.html">Check</a>
      interface. OK, you're right - actually it's not an interface
      but an abstract class to provide some helper methods. A Check provides
      methods that take an AST as an argument and perform the checking process
      for that AST, most prominently <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/Check.html#visitToken(com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.DetailAST)"><code>visitToken()</code></a>.  </p>
<p> It is important to understand that the individual
      Checks do no drive the AST traversal. Instead, the TreeWalker initiates
      a recursive descend from the root of the AST to the leaf nodes and calls
      the Check methods. The traversal is done using a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Depth-FirstTraversal.html" class="externalLink">depth-first</a>
      algorithm.  </p>
<p> Before any visitor method is called, the TreeWalker
      will call <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/Check.html#beginTree(com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.DetailAST)"><code>beginTree()</code></a> to give the Check a chance to do
      some initialization. Then, when performing the recursive descend from
      the root to the leaf nodes, the <code>visitToken()</code>
      method is called. Unlike the basic examples in the pattern book, there
      is a <code>visitToken()</code> counterpart called <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/Check.html#leaveToken(com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.DetailAST)"><code>leaveToken()</code></a>. The TreeWalker will call that
      method to signal that the subtree below the node has been processed and
      the TreeWalker is backtracking from the node. After the root node has
      been left, the TreeWalker will call <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/Check.html#finishTree(com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.DetailAST)"><code>finishTree()</code></a>.  </p>
<p>
        If you'd like to learn more about the Visitor pattern you should
        grab a copy of the Gof
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatternsBook" class="externalLink">Design
        Patterns</a> book.

        Let's get back to our example and start writing code - that's why
        you came here, right?
        When you fire up the Checkstyle GUI and look at a few source
        files you'll figure out pretty quickly that you are mainly
        interested in the number of tree nodes of type METHOD_DEF. The
        number of such tokens should be counted separately for each
        CLASS_DEF / INTERFACE_DEF.
      </p>
<p>
        Hence we need to register the Check for the token types
        CLASS_DEF and INTERFACE_DEF. The TreeWalker will only call
        visitToken for these token types. Because the requirements of
        our tasks are so simple, there is no need to implement the other
        fancy methods, like <code>finishTree()</code>, etc., so here is our first
        shot at our Check implementation:
      </p>
<div class="source"><pre>
package com.mycompany.checks;
import com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.*;

public class MethodLimitCheck extends Check
{
    private static final int DEFAULT_MAX = 30;
    private int max = DEFAULT_MAX;

    @Override
    public int[] getDefaultTokens()
    {
        return new int[]{TokenTypes.CLASS_DEF, TokenTypes.INTERFACE_DEF};
    }

    @Override
    public void visitToken(DetailAST ast)
    {
        // find the OBJBLOCK node below the CLASS_DEF/INTERFACE_DEF
        DetailAST objBlock = ast.findFirstToken(TokenTypes.OBJBLOCK);
        // count the number of direct children of the OBJBLOCK
        // that are METHOD_DEFS
        int methodDefs = objBlock.getChildCount(TokenTypes.METHOD_DEF);
        // report error if limit is reached
        if (methodDefs &gt; this.max) {
            log(ast.getLineNo(),
                &quot;too many methods, only &quot; + this.max + &quot; are allowed&quot;);
        }
   }
}
      </pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="Navigating_the_AST"></a>Navigating the AST</h2>
<p>
        In the example above you already saw that the DetailsAST class
        provides utility methods to extract information from the tree,
        like <code>getChildCount()</code>. By now you have
        probably consulted the api documentation and found that
        DetailsAST additionally provides methods for navigating around
        in the syntax tree, like finding the next sibling of a node, the
        children of a node, the parent of a node, etc.
      </p>
<p>
        These methods provide great power for developing complex
        Checks. Most of the Checks that Checkstyle provides by default
        use these methods to analyze the environment of the ASTs that
        are visited by the TreeWalker.  Don't abuse that feature for
        exploring the whole tree, though. Let the TreeWalker drive the
        tree traversal and limit the visitor to the neighbours of a
        single AST.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="Defining_Check_Properties"></a>Defining Check Properties</h2>
<p>

        Ok Mr. Checkstyle, that's all very nice but in my company we
        have several projects, and each has another number of allowed
        methods. I need to control my Check through properties, so where
        is the API to do that?
      </p>
<p>
        Well, the short answer is, there is no API. It's magic. Really!
      </p>
<p>
        If you need to make something configurable, just add a setter method
        to the Check:
      </p>
<div class="source"><pre>
public class MethodLimitCheck extends Check
{
    // code from above omitted for brevity
    public void setMax(int limit)
    {
        max = limit;
    }
}
      </pre>
</div>
<p>
        With this code added, you can set the property <code>max</code> for the MethodLimitCheck module in the
        configuration file. It doesn't get any simpler than that. The secret is
        that Checkstyle uses JavaBean introspection to set the JavaBean
        properties. That works for all primitive types like boolean,
        int, long, etc., plus Strings, plus arrays of these types.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="Logging_errors"></a>Logging errors</h2>
<p>
        Detecting errors is one thing, presenting them to the user is
        another. To do that, the Check base class provides several log
        methods, the simplest of them being <code>Check.log(String)</code>. In your
        Check you can simply use a verbatim error string like in <code>log(&quot;Too many methods, only &quot; + mMax +
        &quot; are allowed&quot;);</code> as the argument. That will
        work, but it's not the best possible solution if your Check is
        intended for a wider audience.
      </p>
<p>
        If you are not living in a country where people speak English,
        you may have noticed that Checkstyle writes internationalized
        error messages, for example if you live in Germany the error
        messages are German. The individual Checks don't have to do
        anything fancy to achieve this, it's actually quite easy and the
        Checkstyle framework does most of the work.
      </p>
<p>
        To support internationalized error messages, you need to create
        a messages.properties file alongside your Check class, i.e. the
        Java file and the properties files should be in the same
        directory.  Add a symbolic error code and an English
        representation to the messages.properties. The file should
        contain the following line: <code>too.many.methods=Too many methods, only {0} are
        allowed</code>.  Then replace the verbatim error message with
        the symbolic representation and use one of the log helper
        methods to provide the dynamic part of the message (mMax in this
        case): <code>log(&quot;too.many.methods&quot;,
        mMax);</code>. Please consult the documentation of Java's <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html" class="externalLink">MessageFormat</a>
        to learn about the syntax of format strings (especially about
        those funny numbers in the translated text).
      </p>
<p>
        Supporting a new language is very easy now, simply create a new
        messages file for the language, e.g. messages_fr.properties to
        provide french error messages. The correct file will be chosen
        automatically, based on the language settings of the user's
        operating system.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="Integrate_your_Check"></a>Integrate your Check</h2>
<p>
        The great final moment has arrived, you are about to run your
        Check. To integrate your Check, add a new subentry under the
        TreeWalker module of your configuration file. Use the full
        classname of your Check class as the name of the module.
        Your configuration file should look something like this:
      </p>
<div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE module PUBLIC
    &quot;-//Puppy Crawl//DTD Check Configuration 1.3//EN&quot;
    &quot;http://www.puppycrawl.com/dtds/configuration_1_3.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;module name=&quot;Checker&quot;&gt;
  &lt;module name=&quot;TreeWalker&quot;&gt;
          &lt;!-- your standard Checks that come with Checkstyle --&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;UpperEll&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;MethodLength&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;!-- your Check goes here --&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;com.mycompany.checks.MethodLimitCheck&quot;&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;max&quot; value=&quot;45&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/module&gt;
  &lt;/module&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
      </pre>
</div>
<p>
        To run the new Check on the command line compile your Check,
        create a jar that contains the classes and property files,
        e.g. <code>mycompanychecks.jar</code>. Then run
        (with the path separator adjusted to your platform):
      </p>
<div class="source"><pre>
java -classpath mycompanychecks.jar:checkstyle-5.3-all.jar \
     com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.Main \
     -c config.xml -r .
      </pre>
</div>
<p>
        Did you see all those errors about &quot;too many methods&quot;
        flying over your screen? Congratulations. You can now consider
        yourself a Checkstyle expert. Go to your fridge. Have a beer.
      </p>
<p>
        Please consult the <a href="config.html#Packages">Checkstyle
        configuration manual</a> to learn how to integrate your Checks
        into the package configuration so that you can use <code>MethodLimit</code> instead of the full class name.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="Limitations"></a>Limitations</h2>
<p>
        OK, so you have written your first Check, and you have found
        several flaws in many of your programs. You now know that your
        boss does not follow the coding conventions he wrote.  And you
        know that you are the king of the world. To become a programming
        god, you want to write your second Check - now wait, first you
        should know what your limits are.
      </p>
<p>
        There are basically only two of them:
      </p>
<ul><li>You cannot determine the type of an expression.</li>
<li>You cannot see the content of other files. (although you can save processed files for use later)</li>
</ul>
<p>
        This means that you cannot implement some of the code inspection
        features that are available in advanced IDEs like <a href="http://www.intellij.com/idea/" class="externalLink">IntelliJ IDEA</a>. For
        example you will not be able to implement a Check that finds
        redundant type casts or unused public methods.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2><a name="Writing_FileSetChecks"></a>Writing FileSetChecks</h2>
<p> Writing a FileSetCheck is pretty straightforward: Just
      inherit from <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/AbstractFileSetCheck.html">AbstractFileSetCheck</a>
      and override the abstract <a href="apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/AbstractFileSetCheck.html#processFiltered(java.io.File,%20java.util.List)"><code>processFiltered(java.io.File, java.util.List)</code></a> method and you're
      done. A very simple example could fire an error if the number of files
      exceeds a certain limit. Here is a FileSetCheck that does just that:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>
package com.mycompany.checks;
import java.io.File;
import java.util.List;
import com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.*;

public class LimitImplementationFiles extends AbstractFileSetCheck
{
    private static final int DEFAULT_MAX = 100;
    private int fileCount;
    private int max = DEFAULT_MAX;
    public void setMax(int aMax)
    {
        this.max = aMax;
    }

    @Override
    public void beginProcessing(String aCharset)
    {
        super.beginProcessing(aCharset);

        //reset the file count
        this.fileCount = 0;
    }

    @Override
    public void processFiltered(File file, List&lt;String&gt; aLines)
    {
        this.fileCount++;

        if (this.fileCount &gt; this.max) {
            // log the message
            log(0, &quot;max.files.exceeded&quot;, Integer.valueOf(this.max));
            // you can call log() multiple times to flag multiple
            // errors in the same file
        }
    }
}
      </pre>
</div>
<p>
        Note that the configuration via bean introspection also applies
        here.  By implementing the <code>setMax()</code>
        method the FileSetCheck automatically makes &quot;max&quot; a
        legal configuration parameter that you can use in the Checkstyle
        configuration file.
      </p>
<p>
        There are virtually no limits what you can do in
        FileSetChecks. The craziest ideas we've had so far are:
      </p>
<ul><li>to find global code problems like unused public methods.</li>
<li>to find duplicate code.</li>
<li>to port the TreeWalker solution to check C#
        instead of Java.</li>
</ul>
