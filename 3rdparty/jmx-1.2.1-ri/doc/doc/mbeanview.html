        The MBean View
    </H1>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

    <B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=#ACA6CF>Action: &nbsp;</FONT></B>In the Agent
    view, click on the name of the HTML adaptor MBean:
    <CODE>name=html,port=8082</CODE> in the <CODE>Adaptor</CODE>
    domain. This will bring up the MBean view of this object.<P>

    An MBean (<I>managed bean</I>) is a Java object that follows the
    design patterns set forth in the instrumentation level of the JMX<SUP><FONT
        SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>
    specification. An MBean can represent a device, an application, or any
    resource that needs to be managed. MBeans expose a <I>management
    interface</I>: a set of readable and/or writable attributes and a set
    of invokable operations, along with a self-description. The management
    interface does not change throughout the life of an MBean instance.

    <P>

        According to the JMX specification, MBeans can be either standard or
        dynamic. A standard MBean is one that statically defines its
        management interface through the names of the methods it contains. A
        dynamic MBean implements a specific Java interface and reveals its
        attributes and operations at runtime. Since the HTML adaptor just
        displays their management interface, these two types are almost
        indistiguishable in the MBean view (they are compared in <A
            HREF="twombeans.html">Standard and Dynamic MBeans</A>).

    <P>

        The MBean view has two functions: it presents the management interface
        of the MBean and it lets you interact with its instance. The
        management interface of an MBean is given through the name of the
        attributes, the operation signatures, and a self-description. You can
        interact with the MBean by reloading its attribute values, setting new
        values or invoking an operation.

    <P>

        The MBean view can be divided into three main parts:
    <UL>

        <LI>The header with a description</LI>
        <LI>The table of attributes</LI>
        <LI>The operations</LI>
    </UL>

    <A NAME="MBeanDescription"><H3>The Header and Description</H3></A>

    The top part of the page contains the description of the MBean and
    some controls for managing it:<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>
    <IMG SRC="images/mbeanTop.gif" BORDER="2" HEIGHT=250 WIDTH=535>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

    The MBean name is the full object name of this MBean instance. The
    first part up to the colon is the <I>domain</I>, the rest is made up
    of <I>key</I><CODE>=</CODE><I>value</I> pairs. These pairs must be
    unique within a given domain and should help identify the MBean to a
    human reader. It is up to the person or application registering the
    MBean to assign it a meaningful and correct object name. Object names
    are further described in the <A
        HREF="administration.html#ObjectNames">Agent Administration</A> topic.

    <P>

        The MBean Java class is the full class name for the Java object of which
        this MBean is an instance.

    <P>

        The reload controls include a text field for entering a reload period
        and a manual "Reload" button. Originally, the reload period is set to
        zero indicating that the contents of the MBean view are not
        refreshed. Clicking the reload button forces the page to reload,
        thereby updating all of the attribute values displayed. If you have
        entered a reload period, clicking the button begins automatic
        reloading with the given period. The reload period must be greater
        than five seconds.

    <P>

        <B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=#ACA6CF>Action: &nbsp;</FONT></B>Enter a reload
        period of five and click the "Reload" button. Every five seconds the
        page will blink as it reloads. Now open another connection to the HTML
        adaptor and observe the new values for the "ActiveClientCount" and
        "LastConnectedClient" attributes. To do this, load the URL <A
            HREF="http://localhost:8082/">http://localhost:8082/</A> and then use
        the "Previous Page" function of your browser to get back to the
        tutorial. Due to the way the adaptor works, you might have try several
        connections before you see the attribute values change.

    <P>

        The reload period will be reset to zero the next time you go back to
        the agent view and return to this MBean.

    <P>

        The "Unregister" button is a shortcut for removing this MBean from the
        Agent. Unregistering is covered in the <A
            HREF="administration.html">Agent Administration topic</A>.

    <P>

        The MBean description text provides some information about the
        MBean. Because standard MBeans are statically defined, they cannot
        describe themselves, and the MBean server provides a generic
        text. Dynamic MBeans, however, can provide their own description
        string at runtime and are even required to, according to the JMX
        specification. Except for the class name, this is the only way to tell
        standard and dynamic MBeans apart in the MBean view.

        <A NAME="Attributes"><H3>The Table of Attributes</H3></A>

        The second part of the MBean view is a table containing all attributes
        exposed by the MBean. For each attribute, this table lists its name,
        its Java type, its read/write access and a string representation of
        its current value.
    <P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>
    <IMG SRC="images/mbeanAtt.gif" BORDER="2" HEIGHT=471 WIDTH=675>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

    The name of each attribute is a link that opens a dialogue box
    containing the description for this attribute. Like the MBean
    description, attribute descriptions can only be provided by dynamic
    MBeans. The MBean server inserts a generic message for standard
    MBean attributes.

    <P>

        <B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=#ACA6CF>Action: &nbsp;</FONT></B>Click on the
        attribute names of the HTML adaptor to read their description. Since
        the HTML adaptor is implemented as a dynamic MBean, its attribute
        descriptions are meaningful.

        Due to the use of JavaScript<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> commands, these pop-up windows might not
        be available on browsers that are not JavaScript-enabled.

    <P>

        Writable attributes have a text field for entering new values. To set
        the value of a writable attribute, enter or replace its current value
        in the text field and click the "Apply" button at the bottom of the
        attributes table. Despite appearances, you cannot modify the
        attributes of the HTML adaptor, we will see why in the section on <A
            HREF="managing.html">Instantiating and Managing MBeans</A>.

    <P>

        <A NAME="Operations"><H3>The Operations</H3></A>

        The last part of the MBean view contains all of the operations exposed
        by the MBean. Each operation in the list is presented like a method
        signature: there is a return type, then a button with the operation
        name, and if applicable, a list of parameters, each with their type as
        well.
    <P>

    <CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="images/mbeanOps.gif" BORDER="2" HEIGHT=315 WIDTH=672>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

    Above each operation is a link to its description. Parameter
    names are also clickable links which open a window with a
    description text. Again, descriptions are only meaningful for dynamic
    MBeans.

    <P>

        To invoke an operation, you would fill in any parameter values in the
        corresponding text fields and then click the operation's button. The
        HTML adaptor would then display a page with the result of the
        operation: the return value if successful or the reason the operation
        was unsuccessful.

    <P>

        We will not invoke any operations on the HTML parser until a brief
        explanation in <A HREF="managing.html">Instantiating and Managing
        MBeans</A>. If we stopped the HTML adaptor or blocked it with an
        error, there would no longer be any way to connect with a browser: we
        would have to stop the base agent and restart it.

    <P>

        <B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=#ACA6CF>Action: &nbsp;</FONT></B>Go back to the
        agent view by clicking the link near the top of the MBean view page.

    <P>
